Notes on serialization:
    Every message sent has a corresponding class, all of which derive from the
base Message class. Each message class has two common function:
 * serialize() - returns a string representation of the class
 * constructor(vector<string>) - deserialization from the string

The socket class has two functions related to messages:
 * sendMessage() - calls serialize and sends the string over the socket
 * getMessage() - splits the incoming text by whitespace and call the correct
constructor; returns null if the message type of the incoming message is unkown

Note: the first field of a serialized message is always the type of the message
